# garmin-coach-mcp

Personal running coach MCP server. Plan workouts, push them to Garmin
Connect, pull activity history into a local cache, and reason about
training data through Claude.

Built around Marius Bakken's Norwegian threshold method (sub-threshold-
focused training). The framework, HR zones, and per-activity analysis are
exposed as MCP resources so Claude acts as a coach with consistent priors
across sessions.

                    Garmin Connect
              (workouts, calendar, gear,
               activity history, HRV/sleep)
```

Everything flows through Garmin Connect — no Strava account required.
A local SQLite cache sits between Garmin and Claude so weekly analysis
doesn't re-hit the API on every query.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+ ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- Garmin Connect account (MFA supported)
- Claude Desktop ([download](https://claude.ai/download)) **or** Claude Code CLI

### Quick setup (Mac)

Open **Terminal** (search "Terminal" in Spotlight) and run these three commands,
replacing the path in the last one with wherever you cloned the repo:

```bash
# 1. Install Git if you don't have it (opens Xcode tools installer)
git --version

# 2. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/martinbo94/garmin-workout-scheduler.git
cd garmin-workout-scheduler

# 3. Run the setup script
bash setup.sh
```

The script installs dependencies, creates `.env`, authenticates with Garmin
(including MFA if enabled), and registers the server with Claude Desktop.

**First run:** the script will stop after creating `.env` and ask you to fill
in your Garmin email and password. Do that, then run `bash setup.sh` again —
it will authenticate and complete setup.

After setup finishes:
1. Restart Claude Desktop
2. Start a new chat and say **"Let's set up my profile"**

### Manual setup (Claude Code or Windows)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env with your Garmin credentials
```

**Claude Desktop** — add to
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin-coach": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/garmin-coach-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/garmin-coach-mcp/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code** — run once:

```bash
claude mcp add -s user garmin-coach -- \
  <repo>/.venv/bin/python <repo>/server.py
```

### First-time setup in Claude

Restart Claude, then in a fresh session:

```
# Verify the server is registered and healthy
> test garmin connection

# Pull activity history into the local cache (syncs last 12 weeks)
> sync my activities

# Set up your training profile — Claude walks you through it
> Let's set up my profile
```

The profile setup (`user_profile_status` → `init_user_profile`) asks
about max HR (required), optional lactate/VO2max test results, HR zones
from Garmin Connect, race PRs, and athlete type (A/B/C). Only max HR is
required — everything else can be skipped and added later.

If you prefer to hand-write the profile instead:

```bash
cp coach_data/examples/user_profile.example.md coach_data/user_profile.md
# Edit to fill in your own values
```

Both `coach_data/user_profile.md` and `coach_data/plan.json` are
gitignored — they hold personal data and never leave your machine.

### Garmin auth

`setup.sh` handles authentication interactively and caches tokens to
`~/.garminconnect`. After the first run, the MCP logs in automatically
from the token cache — no password or MFA code needed again until the
refresh token expires (typically several months).

**MFA is supported.** If your Garmin account has two-factor
authentication enabled, `setup.sh` will prompt you to enter the code
once. Subsequent logins use the cached token automatically.

Garmin rate-limits login attempts aggressively. You may see `429`
warnings on cold start — the library retries automatically and this is
normal.

  training_philosophy.md      # Bakken framework             → coach://training_philosophy
  plan_design.md               # planning guide              → coach://plan_design
  user_profile.md             # YOUR values (gitignored)     → coach://user_profile
  plan.json                   # YOUR active plan (gitignored)
  cache.db                    # SQLite activity cache (gitignored)
  examples/
    user_profile.example.md   # profile template
    plan.example.json         # sample 1-week Bakken plan structure
```

The framework docs (`workout_classification.md`, `training_philosophy.md`,
`plan_design.md`) and all code are committed and shareable. Your HR
zones, plan, and cached activities live alongside them but stay out of
git.

| `coach://training_philosophy` | The Bakken Norwegian threshold framework — session formats, weekly structure, recovery cues |
| `coach://plan_design` | Step-by-step planning guide with grounding checklist |

## Typical workflows

### Weekly summary
```
> summarize last week
```
Claude reads `coach://classification` + `coach://user_profile`, calls
`weekly_summary`, interprets zone distribution and flags deviations.

### Drafting a plan
```
> Help me draft a 12-week plan starting next Monday.
> Norwegian Singles structure, 2 sub-threshold sessions per week,
> one long run. Race goal in week 12.
```

### Pushing the plan to Garmin
```
> materialize the plan
```

### Morning readiness check
```
> Should I do today's threshold session?
```
Claude calls `morning_check_in`, weighs HRV, sleep, and training
readiness against the session and the Bakken traffic-light cues.

### Mid-week adjustments
```
> Move Tuesday's threshold to Wednesday
```

## Notes

**Background sync:** every MCP server start runs an incremental
`sync_activities` in a daemon thread. Cheap when nothing's new (seconds),
45-60 s for a cold 12-week backfill.

**Zone calibration:** HR zones live in `coach_data/user_profile.md`. When
Garmin's zones change, update the table verbatim. Zone time is recomputed
from raw streams on every query, so updates apply retroactively.

**Plan persistence:** `coach_data/plan.json` is the source of truth for
intent. Garmin calendar is operational state. The two can drift if you
reschedule a lot — compliance comparison still works against the original
plan.

**Local-only:** runs on your machine. Not reachable from Claude on phone
or web without remote hosting (which is out of scope for this project).
