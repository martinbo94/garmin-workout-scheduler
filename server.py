This server is a personal running coach MCP. It connects to Garmin
Connect for workouts, activity history, and wellness data. It hosts
`coach://` resources with training framework docs and the user's
calibrated HR zones and profile.

━━━ FIRST SESSION — NEW USER SETUP ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

At the start of any session, call `user_profile_status` silently.

If the profile is missing or has placeholder values:
1. Tell the user the server is set up but needs a personal profile.
2. Ask: "Do you want to use the Bakken Norwegian threshold framework
   as your training philosophy, or would you prefer to use this mainly
   for creating/editing workouts and tracking health data?"
3. Based on their answer:
   - **Bakken framework**: walk through the full profile setup
     (`user_profile_status` → ask questions → `init_user_profile`),
     then offer to sync activities and explain the weekly review flow.
   - **Workouts + health only**: still run the minimal profile setup
     (max HR is needed for zone computation) but skip the framework
     discussion. Explain the core tools: create_continuous_run /
     create_interval_workout for building sessions, morning_check_in
     for daily readiness, activity_breakdown for reviewing a session.
4. After setup, offer to sync activities: `sync_activities()`. Mention
   that the default window is 12 weeks, and they can call
   `sync_activities(weeks_back=52)` for a full year of history.

If the profile exists and is filled in, proceed normally.

━━━ ROUTING RULES ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. HR ZONES AND PACES come from `get_athlete_profile` (or
   `coach://user_profile`). Never use zones from third-party apps —
   they may use different calibration or be based on a race HR, not
   the user's true max.

2. ACTIVITY ANALYSIS: use `activity_breakdown(activity_id)` for any
   completed session. Returns lap classification, per-lap zone time,
   session category, and overall zone distribution in one call.

3. RECOVERY / READINESS: `morning_check_in` returns HRV, RHR, sleep,
   Garmin training_status, and 7-day trend deltas. Call it before
   deciding whether to push a quality session.

4. WEEKLY VOLUME / ZONE TIME: `weekly_summary`.

━━━ WHEN THE USER USES THE BAKKEN FRAMEWORK ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Pre-analysis protocol (race goal, weekly review, plan tweak):
  a. `get_athlete_profile` — lock in zones, paces, PRs, profile A/B/C.
  b. `morning_check_in` — current readiness.
  c. `weekly_summary` for the relevant window.
  d. `activity_breakdown` for specific reference sessions.
  e. THEN reason — not before.

Interpretation rules for interval sessions:
- Use drag laps' `avg_hr` from `activity_breakdown.laps`, NEVER the
  session-wide `avg_hr`. A 3×6 min sub-threshold session can show
  session avg 165 bpm while the reps were at 184 — concluding "not
  threshold" from session avg is the classic error.
- HR-lag on the first rep: low-Z2 avg with Z3+ max still counts as a
  working rep (the classifier rescues these via the pace co-signal).

Athlete profile and race-goal estimation:
- Profile A (VO2-strong, utilization-weak): Riegel/VDOT overestimate.
  Bias goals slightly conservative.
- Profile B (utilization-strong, VO2-weak): Riegel underestimates.
- Profile C (balanced): Riegel/VDOT as-is.

━━━ WHEN THE USER USES WORKOUTS + HEALTH ONLY ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Core tools:
- Build sessions: `create_continuous_run`, `create_interval_workout`
- Schedule: `schedule_workout`, `reschedule_workout`, `swap_scheduled_workouts`
- Review a session: `activity_breakdown`
- Daily readiness: `morning_check_in`
- Trends: `get_wellness_history`, `weekly_summary`

Skip the Bakken-specific analysis (session_category, profile A/B/C,
sub-threshold band) — just use HR zones and lap data directly.

    1. Use `weekly_summary` for the relevant week to check the cache.
       The activity is almost certainly already there under its Garmin ID.
    2. Only call sync again (with force_full=True) if weekly_summary confirms
       the activity is genuinely absent.

    Args:
        force_full: If True, re-pull the default 12-week backfill window.
            Default False — just pick up new activities since last sync.
        weeks_back: Optional explicit backfill window (e.g. 26 or 52) to
            pull deeper history than the 12-week default. Use when the
            agent needs year-long trajectory data (`weekly_summary` will
            return `gap_warning=True` when the requested range is older
            than what's cached).
        backfill_links: If True, also fetch workout-linkage detail
            (associated_workout_id, planned_type, RPE/feel/compliance,
            training_effect_label) for cached activities synced before
            those fields existed. One extra API call per activity —
            new activities get this automatically; this is only for
            history.
        backfill_max: Max activities to backfill per call (default 100).
            `remaining_without_detail` in the response tells you whether
            another round is needed.

    Returns dict with new_activities count, streams_fetched count,
    laps_fetched count, details_fetched count, last_sync timestamp, and
    any per-activity errors. With backfill_links also details_fetched /
